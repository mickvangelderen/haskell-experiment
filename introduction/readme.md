# Summary
 
 * Haskell is a purely functional programming language.
 * pure functional programming over imperative programming: you tell thecomputer wat everything is, rather than what it should do.
 * Haskell is lazy: It will only compute results of expressions when it needsto.
 * Haskell is statically typed: It can derive types and help you to not makeerrors.
 * The Haskell Platform is Haskell with some extra things you will need 99% of the time. 
 * `ghc` is the compiler to turn Haskell code into executables (I presume).
 * `ghci` is an interactive prompt which compiles Haskell code on the fly.
 * Inside `ghci`:
    * `:l scriptname` loads `scriptname.hs`.
    * `:r` reloads the last loaded script.
